## Semantic Search QnA

This repository contains code for a semantic search question-and-answer (QnA) system using embeddings generated by the Sentence Transformers library. The system embeds questions, calculates cosine similarity to find the most relevant answers from a dataset, and utilizes a generative AI model to respond to queries.
